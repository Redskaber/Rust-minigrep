Later, I realized that many things are useless, 
just like you are holding a cup of boiling water. 
Although it is verythirsty, 
I feel that it will be put down.
Sometimes, 
we are like a fish in a fishtank. 
I want to say a lot, and an opening turns into a series of ellipsis.
Life is like a train. 
When someone entersthe station, 
someone will get on the bus. Someone has to get off the bus. 
Witha journey, 
let go when you let go. 
This is the best end to each other.
